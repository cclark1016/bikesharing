## Results

In order to be succesful in Des Moines a bikesharing business will have to ensure that they understand how many bikes are needed at popular and unpopular locations to meet demand at different times of day. The visualizations clearly show that a majority of bikesharing business happens during certain hours on weekdays and weekend and has certain hotspots of activity. Gender does appaear to be a factor in how these trends play out, although more males use the bikesharing service than females. 

Additional visualizations that would be helpful would be one that doesnt look at gender just by total count but divides it into a %. This would help compare trends between genders without them being skewed by the fact more males ride bikes than females. Another visualzation that would be helpful is the ability to look at the most common starting and ending locations for single rides. This would help determine how to divide different neighborhoods of a city.
